# Introduction

A large portion of contemporary vulnerabilities primarily stem from heap based
bugs. They primary fall into the categories:

- Heap Data Corruption
- Heap Metadata Corruption
- Double Free
- Use After Free

Debugging these bugs to develop a functional exploit beyond denial-of-service
conditions can be difficult in certain complex situations involving interactions
between allocation function calls.

# Memory Allocation

We focus on ptmalloc2, the allocator implementation used in glibc of most Linux
systems.
